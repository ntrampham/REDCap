# CVE-2023-38825: SQL Injection in REDCap Versions <13.8.0

## Issue Summary
An SQL Injection vulnerability was found on `/<redcap_version>/MyCapMobileApp/update.php` API. Because of lacking of verifying untrusted data `$_POST['index_modal_update']` results in malicious payload being passed to the SQL query via the `$page_id` variable.

After sending the malicious payload, the response time exceedsÂ 5 seconds.

## Issue Impact
An attacker can employ a SQL Injection attack to dump all data from the database.

Besides that, the REDCap password reset mechanism requires a `password_reset_key` provided in the URL delivered to the user. An attacker can quickly obtain this key using the SQL Injection bug already found and change the passwords of any REDCap users by forging their password reset requests. Then he can access whatever account he wants, especially the admin account.
